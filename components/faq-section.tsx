      question: "How does the honey-based formula work?",
      answer:
        "Our honey-based delivery system enhances the absorption of herbal ingredients. Honey acts as a natural carrier, allowing the active compounds to be absorbed more efficiently into your system. The natural sugars in honey also provide immediate energy while the herbs work synergistically for extended benefits.",

      question: "What makes Turkish herbs special?",

    {
      question: "How should I store the product?",
